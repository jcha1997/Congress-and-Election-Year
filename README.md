Congress by Election Year
================
Jeremiah Cha

A simple dataset that pairs each session of the U.S. Congress with their
election years. Additional variables include the start and end of the
term.

# Installing

Start by downloading the `.csv`, `.dta` or `.rds` file in this
repository. Importing the `.dta` format into R requires external
packages, such as
[`haven`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/haven/haven.pdf). The
`.rds` file can be read into R with the following code.

``` r
df <- readRDS("congyear.rds")
```

Reading in the `.rds` file imports a tibble, which is compatible with
the `tidyverse` suite. A preview of the data is featured below.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
df
```
