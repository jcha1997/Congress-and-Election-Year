A simple dataset that pairs each session of the U.S. Congress with their election years. Additional variables include the start and end of the term. 

# Installing

Start by downloading the `.csv`, `.dta` or `.rds` file in this repository. Importing the `.dta` format into R requires external packages, such as [`haven`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/haven/haven.pdf). The `.rds` file can be read into R with the following code. 

```{r}
df <- readRDS("congyear.rds")
```

Reading in the `.rds` file imports a tibble, which is compatible with the `tidyverse` suite. A preview of the data is featured below. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
df
```
